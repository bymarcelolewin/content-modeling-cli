# Product Requirements Document: Content Modeling MCP Server and CLI MCP Server Initial Development

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the requirements for integrating an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server with the existing Content Modeling MCP Server and CLI. The goal is to expose CLI commands as MCP tools.

## 2. Goals
- Establish a functional MCP server for the Content Modeling MCP Server and CLI.
- Expose key CLI commands as callable tools within the MCP framework.
- Enable automated content model management through MCP tasks.

## 3. Scope
This phase will focus on:
- Setting up the basic MCP server.
- Implementing a test endpoint (e.g., "Give me the latest version of the Content Modeling MCP Server and CLI.").
- Integrating the `cm.js` commands as MCP tools, starting with one command and then iteratively adding others.

## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1. MCP Server Setup
- The MCP server must be runnable locally and deployable.
- It should be able to receive and process requests from the MCP client.

### 4.2. Test Endpoint
- A simple endpoint, such as "content modeling version," should be implemented to verify server connectivity and basic functionality. This endpoint should return the version of the Content Modeling MCP Server and CLI.

### 4.3. CLI Command Integration (as MCP Tools)
- Each relevant command from `cli-commands/cm.js` (and subsequently other `cli-commands` files) should be exposed as an individual MCP tool.
- Each tool should correctly map CLI arguments to MCP tool parameters.
- The tools should execute the underlying CLI command and return its output.

## 5. Technical Design Considerations

### 5.1. Server Framework
- Node.js with Express or a similar lightweight framework is recommended for the MCP server.

### 5.2. Command Execution
- Child processes or similar mechanisms should be used to execute CLI commands from the MCP server.
- Proper handling of stdout, stderr, and exit codes from CLI commands is required.

### 5.3. Configuration
- Configuration for Contentful API keys, space IDs, etc., should be manageable within the MCP server environment.

## 6. Commands to Integrate (Initial Phase)
The initial focus will be on the commands found in `cli-commands/cm.js`. We will start with one, for example, a version command if available, or a simple `list-content-models` command to test the integration.

## 7. Future Considerations
- Error handling and logging.
- Security and authentication for the MCP server.
- More advanced task orchestration and dependency management.
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines.
